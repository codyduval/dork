dork
====

A tree based text adventure game engine, inspired by Infocom's Zork.

[The engine](https://github.com/codyduval/dork/blob/master/lib/dork.rb) consists of a handful of classes in a single file.  You can see a [sample game script](https://github.com/codyduval/dork/blob/master/game_scripts/sample.yml) which creates a small world where the player needs to find all of the tools and ingredients to make and eat scrambled eggs.

And Rspec tests for the engine are [here](https://github.com/codyduval/dork/blob/master/spec/lib/dork_spec.rb).
